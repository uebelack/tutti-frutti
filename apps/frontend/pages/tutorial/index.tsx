    <h2>Tutti Frutti Game Instructions</h2>
    <h3>How do you play Tutti Frutti?</h3>
    <p>This game is about how fast you can choose the right word for a randomly selected category and a starting letter.
      Each game lasts 30 seconds and the goal is to play as many rounds as possible. The more words you choose correctly, the more points you get.</p>

    <h3>How does the 50:50 Lifeline work?</h3>
    <p>You can click on the 50:50 button if you get stuck to eliminate 50% of the wrong answers. But keep in mind that for every game you can use the 50:50 lifeline only ones.
      Unless you are among the top 10 in the ranking, then you are allowed to use the 50:50 lifeline even twice.</p>

    <h3>How are points counted?</h3>
    <p>For every right answer you get 10 points, for every wrong answer you lose 20 points. If you don&apos;t know the answer for sure,
      it might make more sense to skip the round with the skip button.</p>
